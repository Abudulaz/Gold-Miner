**OVERVIEW**

This module aims to build upon fundamental concepts involved in the
creation of a game prototype with reference to industry-level rational
design and employing critical analysis and research.

This module will examine the contrast between the creation of a strong
core mechanic, which is immediately tactile, and how it can be expanded
upon through player learning, subtractive design and variety to provide
longevity. Ultimately providing an accessible, engaging and substantial
gameplay experience informed by playtesting.

Students will enhance their skills both inside and outside of a
contemporary game engine. Inspired by the structure of relevant titles,
they will be encouraged to rigorously plan tasks from a macro and micro
perspective prior to development.

Assessment will be 100% ICA, based on the creation of a playable
prototype within a game engine alongside a supporting pre-production
documents.

<img src="./ztkieyyb.png" style="width:7.5in;height:10.83333in" />**ICA**
**BRIEFING**

You will be required to develop a prototype that **focuses** **on**
**a** **core** **mechanic** and its progression. To facilitate
progression, you will also develop **three** **opposing** **mechanics**
i.e. enemies.

The core mechanic must be tactile and responsive as such **puzzle**
**mechanics** **should** **not** **be** **considered** for this.

Consider options such as:

• Player movement

• Platforming

• Combat

• Or your own ideas

Ensure your core mechanic is communicated to your tutor in the studios.

Once a basic prototype has been created, you will **identify**
**various** **atomic** **values** relevant to your prototype and
populate these into a matrix.

You will **use** **the** **matrices** **to** **develop** **the**
**core** **mechanics** **progression** and iterate on your designs
through rigours playtesting.

<img src="./ea51uu41.png" style="width:7.5in;height:10.83333in" />**ICA**
**BRIEFING**

You are expected to expected to keep a **series** **of** **live**
**production** **documents** including:

• Design Document & Progression Synopsis

• Schedule

• Task List

• Bug tracking

• Playtesting Diary

Finally, prior to submission you should compile **a** **brief**
**document** **illustrating** **the** **link** **between** **the**
**matrices** **and**

**progression**. Graphs should be included where necessary to visualise
the correlation.

**2** **(50%)** Prototype

**An** **interactive** **prototype** that demonstrates the progression
of a core mechanic through three variants. It should also include three
opposing mechanics each with three variants. (See table)

The prototype should clearly demonstrate the connection between atomic
scaling and challenging scenarios informed by a pre-production plan and
design iterations.

Development will be undertaken within a contemporary game engine and
should be compiled as an executable for use on the Windows PC platform
utilising associated peripherals for interaction and feedback.

**A** **gameplay** **video** demonstrating the mechanics should also be
included.

**BESTPRACTICE** **GUIDANCE**

**First** **and** **foremost,** **ensure** **you** **have** **read**
**and** **fully** **understood**

**the** **assessment** introduction and criteria, this tells you exactly
what will

be assessed within your submission. Secondly, look at the hand-in
requirements and limitations set out within this document.

**Think** **of** **how** **much** **time** **you** **will**
**realistically** **have** on this project. It would be better to create
a smaller detailed game prototype. Try and focus on creating a
small-scale quality prototype in both its visuals and its gameplay.

**Refer** **to** **the** **development** **guide** to ensure you have
covered all areas during the production of your level. We are looking
for a fully fleshed small scale game level making full use of visuals,
dynamics and scripted gameplay.

**Carry** **out** **the** **necessary** **pre-production** **work**
prior to committing a design. Keep things workable and concise. Do not
make the mistake of creating a large-scale systems which you can never
complete.

**Iterate** **and** **develop** **aspects** **of** **your** **design**
to ensure gameplay polish is to a high standard. Be sure to test and
polish all mechanics progressively.

**Keep** **the** **artwork** **simple** **and** **manageable**, art
assets should serve a clear visual function and be readable from a
gameplay perspective.

**Keep** **a** **weekly** **schedule** **with** **tasks** **that**
**need** **to** **be** **completed**. It is easy to fall behind during
the production phase. Planning and self-management is very important.
Try and be as productive as possible without losing focus on important
development milestones.

**Get** **weekly** **feedback** **and** **help** **from** **your**
**tutor**, it is essential you get iterative feedback on all aspects of
development to ensure your work is progressively improving in quality

> **DOCUMENT&** **PROGRESSIONSYNOPSIS** **(10%)**

**Grade** **Criteria**

**7** **-10** A sound design. A very good array of visual means are used
to illustrate important design points and convey your concept. The
design fits the brief well and displays a good degree of originality.
Most/All aspects of the level progression are covered and discussed in
an intelligent manner.

**6** Well written document. A good balance of text and visual means to
convey your concept, images, diagrams and/or flowcharts and references
are included to illustrate

> points. Work hard to describe the items that help to show level
> progression

**5** Reasonable document and design. Communicates the concept quite
well, although there is room for improvement. Visuals can really help
get your ideas across

**4** There is some evidence that shows a suitable level flow has been
worked on but it does not go far enough to be usable in a design
environment.

**1-3** There is little in the way of a game scenario. You have not
described how the level will flow or develop through level progression

> <img src="./epaynyeb.png" style="width:7.5in;height:10.83333in" />**MECHANIC**
> **MATRICES(20%)**

**Grade** **Criteria**

**14-20** The matrices you have developed are very strong in terms of
balanced and feasible atomic values and how this data can be balanced
against the values for the three other in-game opponents. The data sets
you used would be easily transferred into a game engine for further
development.

**12-14** Your development matrices show good variation and thought in
their development. There is evidence that thought has been applied to
their use and how they balance against other game elements giving a
strong level progression.

**10-12** Reasonable effort has been made to convey the development of
mechanics through alteration of the atomic values. You show some
imagination in their use but this could have been taken further.

**8** **-10** The matrices show some evidence of thought in their
production but could have been expanded further to help make the game
progression easier to develop in terms of gameplay and opposition.

**1-7** The matrices show little evidence of thought in their use in a
development process. They need to have a clear correlation between their
development and level progression.

> <img src="./hrjejvsk.png" style="width:7.5in;height:10.83333in" />**PRODUCTION**
> **PLAN** **(10%)**

**Grade** **Criteria**

**7** **-10** Your production plan and development schedule shows an
excellent understanding of the processes required to create working
documents that are suitable for the game development industry. You have
included all the elements required and created contingencies for stretch
goals if applicable.

**6** Your production plan and development schedule shows a good amount
of effort has been made to include areas needed for development and the
creation of a competent schedule suitable for its development.

**5** Your production plan and development schedule shows that a
reasonable effort has been made to include the areas for development and
some thought has gone into creating a suitable schedule for production.

**4** Your production plan and development schedule show some work and
thought but do not go far enough to be useful in a game development
environment.

**1-3** You have shown little evidence that any effort has gone into
this section. Production planning is a critical stage of any game
development.

> <img src="./svel02fq.png" style="width:7.5in;height:10.83333in" />**COMPARISON**
> **DOCUMENT** **(10%)**

**Grade** **Criteria**

**7** **-10** Your comparison document is of a very high quality. You
show very strong correlation between the described level progression and
the data sets given in the matrices. All the evidence has been tied
neatly together showing a real understanding on how the relevant
information work together to create meaningful gameplay and progression.

**6** Your comparison document is well put together and show a strong
link between the level progression and the atomic data described in your
matrices. You give a good account on how one will affect the other but
could still go further in the descriptions and documentation of
evidence.

**5** Your comparison document is fairly well presented and goes some
way to describe the correlation between level progressions and your
atomic data sets but it could still go further in its descriptions and
evidence of relevance between the elements.

**4** Your comparison document shows some correlation between the level
progression and atomic matrices but it does not go far enough to prove
the links are valid or would be of any benefit to gameplay.

**1-3** Your comparison document does not show any real correlation
between your level progression and the atomic data shown in your
matrices.

> <img src="./sd2z1llv.png" style="width:7.5in;height:10.83333in" />**PROTOTYPE**
> **(50%)**

**Grade** **Criteria**

**35-50** The prototypes you created clearly show how the datasets your
created for the atomic values have been turned into meaningful gameplay
and level progression. Your datasets were successful in creating
exciting gameplay which increases in difficulty whilst remaining
entertaining and balanced.

**30-35** The prototypes you created are of a good standard and show
that a good effort has been made to turn the datasets described into
meaningful gameplay and level progression. Some more effort is needed to
show an exact replica of the data but this is a good effort.

**25-29** The prototypes you created are of a reasonable quality and
show that some effort and thought has gone into their development and
some effort has been made to follow your data sets to help create a
meaningful level progression.

**20-24** The prototypes you created go some way in demonstrating the
level progression and manipulation of atomic values but it falls well
short of what was required.

**1-19** The prototypes you created do not show how the data sets have
been used to create meaningful level progression or interesting
gameplay.

<img src="./adb4o31q.png" style="width:7.5in;height:10.83333in" />**GRACEPERIOD**
**&** **RESITS**

**SUBMISSION** **GRADING**

Students receiving below 50%, will have failed the module ICA. You may
be entitled to a resubmission, where you would be expected to make good
on the previous effort.

Students who fail the module overall, may still be entitled to a
resubmission, this would need to be ratified by the exam board and you
would be contacted to inform you of the procedure.

**MISSING** **COMPONENTS**

Missing elements of the ICA will have a dramatic impact on the potential
to pass the module. You are highly advised to complete all elements.

Should you only complete a certain percentage of any one element, you
are advised to still submit whatever you have, regardless of whether it
is complete.

**GRACE** **PERIOD**

You can submit up to a maximum of 7 days after the original deadline,
any such submission would be capped at a maximum of a Pass. Any
submission after the 7-day grace period would be classified as a fail.

If you have an extension, then the 7-day grace period still applies.

**RESITS**

Students who fail may be entitled to a resubmission; this will be
determined by the assessment board at the end of the academic year.

You will be contacted by admin and given a submission deadline. Initial
submission feedback will provide you with guidance on the areas you to
need to concentrate on to ensure a valid pass.

Resubmissions would also be capped at a maximum of a pass. Any
subsequent fails would again go to the exam board to decide upon student
progression.

<img src="./jkax5ufd.png" style="width:7.5in;height:10.83333in" />**ICA**
**EXTENSIONS**

There is the possibility of an extension being granted which extends the
initial deadline date with no penalty. Following this revised deadline,
a one-week grace period will commence.

To request an extension, contact your tutor in the first instance who
may refer you onto your module or course leader. Please note that
extension requests require evidence, and **all** **of** **the**
**following** **are** **NOT** **VALID** **reasons** **for**
**requesting** **an** **extension:**

• Study related circumstances (personal equipment failure, printer
problems, failure to take back-up copy of work, misreading the
examination timetable, oversleeping, taking the wrong examination).

• Normal exam stress or anxiety experienced during revision or the
assessment period.

• Personal disruptions within a student’s control (moving house, change
of job, normal job pressure, holidays, weddings, failed travel
arrangements, financial issues, poor time-management, routine medical
appointments, disruption to routine caring responsibilities).

• Grounds of religion, unless notification was given at the start of the
academic year.

• Foreseeable and preventable circumstances.

• Statement of a medical condition without reasonable evidence (medical
or otherwise) to support the case.

• Complaints against staff or in relation to delivery of the
module/programme. (These are managed through the University’s Student
Complaints Policy and Procedure).

• Medical circumstances outside the relevant assessment or learning
period for which appropriate adjustments for extenuating circumstances
have already been made.

• Long term health condition, for which a student is already receiving
reasonable and appropriate adjustments.

• Medical condition supported only by retrospective evidence (such as a
doctor’s note stating that a student was seen after the illness, and
that a student declared they had been ill previously).

• Late disclosure of circumstances, where a student could reasonably be
expected to have contacted a member of staff about the problem, but did
not do so.
