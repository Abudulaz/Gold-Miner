  - Increased break threshold to 200% of max (rope only breaks at 1000 stress)
  - Further reduced rope repair time to 1.5 seconds
- Redesigned the stress calculation approach:
  - Added diminishing returns for heavy objects using square root formula
  - Implemented hard cap of 1% max stress per frame
  - Created more gradual stress accumulation for sustainable gameplay
- Reduced stress impact multipliers by another 50%:

## [2025-04-23 01:55:58] Explanation: Stress Decay Rate
**Files Examined**: RopeManager.cs
**User Request**: "What does stress decay rate do in @RopeManager.cs?"

**Explanation**:
- The `stressDecayRate` parameter in RopeManager.cs controls how quickly the rope recovers from stress:
  - It determines how many units of stress are removed per second when the rope is not being used
  - Higher values = faster recovery from stress (current value: 2.0)
  - Lower values = slower recovery from stress
- How it works technically:
  - In the `Update()` method, the game subtracts `stressDecayRate * Time.deltaTime` from `currentStress` each frame
  - This creates a constant recovery rate over time when the rope isn't being used
  - The current value of 2.0 means the rope loses 2 stress units per second
  - With our max stress of 500, it would take 250 seconds (≈4 minutes) for a fully stressed rope to recover completely
  - The decay happens continuously even while playing, so the rope is constantly trying to recover
- Gameplay implications:
  - Higher decay rate creates more forgiving gameplay as stress dissipates quickly
  - Lower decay rate would create more challenging gameplay by making stress accumulate over time
  - Current high value (2.0) ensures players can pull multiple objects in succession without breaking the rope
  - This parameter is independent of how quickly stress accumulates, which is controlled by other parameters
- Related parameters that work together with stress decay:
  - `maxStress`: Total stress capacity before breaking (current: 500)
  - `breakThreshold`: Percentage of max stress that causes breaks (current: 200%)
  - `stressPerPull`: Base stress added per pull (current: 0.1)
  - `stressPerWeightUnit`: Additional stress per weight unit (current: 0.01)

## [2025-04-23 03:31:08] Added floating text feature when rope breaks
- Added floating text feature when rope breaks
- Modified PlayerController.cs to show "Rope Broke!" text at hook position
- Modified RopeManager.cs to show "Stress Limit!" text at player position

- Note: FloatingTextPrefab needs to be copied from Prefabs folder to Resources folder for this feature to work correctly

## [2025-04-23 03:32:16] Editor Script for Floating Text
- Created Editor script (CopyPrefabToResources.cs) for simplified setup
- Added menu item (Tools/Setup/Copy FloatingTextPrefab to Resources) to copy prefab to correct location

## [2025-04-23 03:33:24] Added documentation for floating text feature in Docs/FloatingTextFeature.md
- Added documentation for floating text feature in Docs/FloatingTextFeature.md
- Documentation includes setup instructions, how it works, customization options, and troubleshooting
- Both automatic (via editor script) and manual setup procedures are documented
