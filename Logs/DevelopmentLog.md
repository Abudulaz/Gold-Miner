## [2025-04-23 01:55:58] Explanation: Stress Decay Rate
**Files Examined**: RopeManager.cs
**User Request**: "What does stress decay rate do in @RopeManager.cs?"

**Explanation**:
- The `stressDecayRate` parameter in RopeManager.cs controls how quickly the rope recovers from stress:
  - It determines how many units of stress are removed per second when the rope is not being used
  - Higher values = faster recovery from stress (current value: 2.0)
  - Lower values = slower recovery from stress
- How it works technically:
  - In the `Update()` method, the game subtracts `stressDecayRate * Time.deltaTime` from `currentStress` each frame
  - This creates a constant recovery rate over time when the rope isn't being used
  - The current value of 2.0 means the rope loses 2 stress units per second
  - With our max stress of 500, it would take 250 seconds (≈4 minutes) for a fully stressed rope to recover completely
  - The decay happens continuously even while playing, so the rope is constantly trying to recover
- Gameplay implications:
  - Higher decay rate creates more forgiving gameplay as stress dissipates quickly
  - Lower decay rate would create more challenging gameplay by making stress accumulate over time
  - Current high value (2.0) ensures players can pull multiple objects in succession without breaking the rope
  - This parameter is independent of how quickly stress accumulates, which is controlled by other parameters
- Related parameters that work together with stress decay:
  - `maxStress`: Total stress capacity before breaking (current: 500)
  - `breakThreshold`: Percentage of max stress that causes breaks (current: 200%)
  - `stressPerPull`: Base stress added per pull (current: 0.1)
  - `stressPerWeightUnit`: Additional stress per weight unit (current: 0.01)

## [2025-04-30 02:47:50] Redworm Explosion Effect
**Files Changed**: Redworm.cs
**User Request**: "Can you add ExplosionEffectPrefab @ExplosionEffect.cs for redworm so it will explode upon touched by hook, make sure @ExplosionEffect.cs works with redworm, just add this function do not change other functionality of redwrom"

**Changes**:
- Added public `explosionPrefab` field to `Redworm.cs`.
- Implemented `OnTriggerEnter2D` to detect collision with objects tagged "Hook".
- When the hook collides, instantiate the `explosionPrefab` at the redworm's position.
- Called existing `ApplyHookPenalty` logic.
- Destroyed the redworm GameObject immediately after collision and explosion.
- Kept the old `AttachToHook` method with a warning, as `OnTriggerEnter2D` is preferred if the hook uses a trigger collider. 

## [2025-04-30 02:52:42] Redworm Collision Fix
**Files Changed**: Redworm.cs
**User Request**: "I think hook use sphere collider which is 3d and the colider is created by script @Hook.cs, can you make redworm also use 3d colider instead so you don't have to change @Hook.cs ? because they are all actually 3d objects altough played in 2d view"

  - PlayerController.cs
  - Redworm.cs
  - Dynamite.cs
- This implementation creates a continuous gameplay loop where:
  - Player completes a level
  - Shop appears if money is positive
  - After purchasing upgrades, player continues to next level
  - Level counter increases
  - All objects are cleared and new ones are spawned 

## [2025-04-30 04:09:26] Fixed UIManager References
**Files Changed**: UIManager.cs
**User Request**: "Assets\Scripts\UIManager.cs(95,58): error CS1061: 'GameManager' does not contain a definition for 'score' and no accessible extension method 'score' accepting a first argument of type 'GameManager' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)"

**Changes**:

- This ensures that players can only proceed to the store and next level if they have a strictly positive amount of money
- Players with exactly zero money will now see the game over screen 

## [2025-04-30 05:15:46] Rope Count System and Shop Integration
**Files Changed**: RopeManager.cs, UIManager.cs, StoreManager.cs, Gold_Miner_Detailed_Matrix_V2.csv, MatrixExtractedForItemGenerator.csv
**User Request**: "Make a new variable called RopesCount for @RopeManager.cs, so everytime the the rope breaks, it should cost 1 rope of RopesCount, and you can make a new text element to show the RopesCount. Additionally, add this RopesCount as an mandatory shop item that always be on the shelf to be avialiable to purchase by player, and by the 'difficulty level' inscrease in @GameManager.cs, the item quantity of rope in shop also go up."

**Changes**:
- Added RopesCount system to RopeManager.cs:
  - Added a ropesCount property with a default of 3 ropes
  - Decremented rope count each time rope breaks from stress
  - Added Game Over trigger if player runs out of ropes
  - Added a UI reference for displaying rope count
  - Created an event system to notify of rope count changes
  - Added AddRopes method to increase rope count
- Updated UIManager.cs to display the rope count:
  - Added a ropesCountText UI element reference
  - Subscribe to rope count change events
  - Added methods to update the UI when rope count changes
- Modified StoreManager.cs to make ropes a mandatory shop item:
  - Added spareRopesItemID field to identify the rope item
  - Created EnsureSpareRopesAvailable method to always include ropes in store
  - Modified SelectRandomStoreItems to exclude mandatory items from random selection
  - Updated PlayerOwnsItem to allow rope item to be purchased multiple times
  - Implemented purchase handling for rope items based on difficulty level
  - Added rope item to default shop items
  - Added UpdateDifficultyLevel method to scale item quantities with game progress
- Updated CSV data files to include Spare Ropes item:
  - Added to Gold_Miner_Detailed_Matrix_V2.csv with 3 difficulty variations
  - Updated MatrixExtractedForItemGenerator.csv for the item generator
  - Variation details: +1 rope (100 money), +2 ropes (175 money), +3 ropes (225 money)
- This implementation creates a game economy where:
  - Player must manage their ropes as a limited resource
  - Game ends if player runs out of ropes
  - Store always offers ropes for purchase at varying quantities
  - Higher difficulty/levels provide more ropes per purchase but at higher prices 

## [2025-04-30 05:37:16] Out-of-Ropes Behavior Update
**Files Changed**: RopeManager.cs, FloatingText.cs
**User Request**: "It's good, now if the ropes runs out, just let the store panel to pop so player may purchase ropes and proceed to next level"

**Changes**:
- Modified RopeManager.cs to open the store panel instead of ending the game when a player runs out of ropes
- Added a clear visual notification "Out of Ropes! Visit Store" when this happens
- Enhanced FloatingText.cs to support custom text colors and display durations:
  - Added Color parameter to make important messages more visible (red for out of ropes)
  - Added custom lifetime parameter to make critical messages stay longer
  - Updated both Create and CreateWorldToUI methods to support the new parameters
- This creates a more player-friendly experience where:
  - Running out of ropes no longer immediately ends the game
  - Players can continue playing by purchasing more ropes from the store
  - The seamless transition to the store encourages resource management
  - The prominent red warning text clearly indicates what happened 

## [2025-04-30 05:46:08] Fixed RopeManager Variable Redeclaration
**Files Changed**: RopeManager.cs
**User Request**: "Assets\Scripts\RopeManager.cs(179,30): error CS0136: A local or parameter named 'player' cannot be declared in this scope because that name is used in an enclosing local scope to define a local or parameter"

**Changes**:
- Fixed a compilation error in RopeManager.cs where the variable 'player' was declared twice in the same method
- Renamed the second instance of the 'player' variable to 'playerController' to avoid the naming conflict
- This resolved the CS0136 error that was preventing compilation
- The update maintains the same functionality while fixing the code issue 

## [2025-04-30 06:05:12] Added Item Teleport Feature for Rope Breaks
**Files Changed**: PlayerController.cs
**User Request**: "When the rope breaks and the item that hook was dragging was left beyond spawning zone, teleport the item back to its nearest position of the spawning zone"

**Changes**:
- Enhanced the `OnRopeBreak` method in PlayerController.cs to check if the caught object is outside the spawn area
- Added code to get the spawn boundaries directly from GameManager (width, height, Y offset)
- Implemented position clamping to find the nearest valid position within the spawn area
- When an object is outside the spawn area, it's now teleported to the nearest point inside
- Added a cyan "Item Teleported!" floating text message to provide visual feedback
- Added detailed logging to record when objects are teleported
- This ensures valuable collectibles aren't lost outside the playable area when a rope breaks
- The teleport uses the exact spawn area values defined in GameManager for consistency 

## [2025-04-30 06:22:45] Fixed Hook State Inconsistency
**Files Changed**: PlayerController.cs
**User Request**: "Sometime although the hook is in standby aka swing state, there's still something on the hook, this is likely to happen when the rope breaks and rope recovers and player use this recovered rope to hook something, somehow @PlayerController.cs force the hook to reset into the swing state while in the middle of the dragging"

**Changes**:
- Added new `ValidateState()` method that runs every frame to detect and correct hook state inconsistencies
- Implemented automatic detection and repair for two key issues:
  1. Objects remaining attached while in Swinging state (now auto-detaches)
  2. Being in Pulling state without an attached object (now transitions to Retracting)
- Added a safeguard in `CatchObject()` to prevent attaching multiple objects
- Enhanced `OnRopeRepaired()` to double-check no object remains attached when returning to Swinging state
- Added detailed warning logs to help identify when these edge cases occur
- This resolves the issue where objects could remain visually attached to the hook while in swing mode
- The validation runs every frame, ensuring the game state remains consistent even during complex interactions 

## [2025-04-30 06:48:23] Fixed Store Item Button Functionality
**Files Changed**: StoreItemUI.cs
**User Request**: "I can't press the button on @StoreItemPrefab.prefab that spawned by the @StoreManager.cs"

**Changes**:
- Fixed a critical bug in the `StoreItemUI.Setup()` method where button click events weren't being registered
- Added `purchaseButton.onClick.RemoveAllListeners()` to clear any previous listeners
- Added `purchaseButton.onClick.AddListener(OnPurchaseClicked)` to properly register the click handler
- Added debug logging to confirm successful button registration
- This resolves the issue where store item buttons were visible but couldn't be clicked
- Players can now properly interact with the store interface to purchase items 

## [2025-04-30 07:15:48] Rope Pricing and Difficulty Scaling Update
**Files Changed**: StoreManager.cs
**User Request**: "Player should start with 3 ropes, but the rope price you should dial it down a bit, and instead of making easy medium hard, just make the price scale based on the 'current level' in @GameManager.cs, and this 'current level' in @GameManager.cs should be only variable that controls what the level that players in and all other script would use this variable as difficult scaler if needed"

**Changes**:
- Completely removed standalone `difficultyLevel` variable from StoreManager
- Created `GetDifficultyLevel()` method that derives difficulty (0-2) from GameManager.currentLevel
- Adjusted rope pricing to scale directly with game level using formula: 50 + (level × 10)
  - Level 1: 60 money
  - Level 2: 70 money
  - Level 3: 80 money
  - And so on...
- Modified rope quantity to scale naturally with level progression:
  - Levels 1-3: 1 rope
  - Levels 4-6: 2 ropes
  - Level 7+: 3 ropes
- Updated all store item creation to use `GetDifficultyLevel()` instead of direct variable access
- Ensured all difficulty scaling is consistently derived from the single GameManager.currentLevel value
- Maintained the 3 starting ropes in RopeManager as already implemented 

## [2025-04-30 07:42:31] Level-Based Redworm Scaling
**Files Changed**: GameManager.cs, Gold_Miner_Detailed_Matrix_V2.csv
**User Request**: "Also make sure the redworm's spawning quantity would scale based on the 'current level' in @GameManager.cs and reflect this update @Gold_Miner_Detailed_Matrix_V2.csv"

**Changes**:
- Modified GameManager.SpawnRandomObject to implement level-based scaling for redworm spawning:
  - Redworm spawn chance now increases by 1% per level (from 15% base to max 35%)
  - Gold spawn chance adjusts dynamically to accommodate increased redworm probability
  - Rock probability remains constant at 50%
  - Added debug logging to track spawn distribution changes
- Enhanced redworm type distribution in GameManager.SpawnRedworm:
  - Fast redworm chance scales from 10% to max 60% as level increases
  - Medium redworm chance scales from 20% to max 50% as level increases 
  - Slow redworm chance decreases proportionally as the other types increase
  - Added debug logs for each spawned redworm type
- Updated Gold_Miner_Detailed_Matrix_V2.csv to reflect these changes:
  - Changed "Difficulty Level" to "Base Spawn Chance" and "Level Scaling" columns
  - Added detailed percentage information for each enemy type
  - Added new "Redworm Type Distribution" section with level-based breakdown
  - Updated Spare Ropes entry to show level-based quantities instead of fixed prices 

## [2025-04-30 08:17:56] Added Level Display UI
**Files Changed**: UIManager.cs, Assets/Prefabs/LevelTextUI.prefab, Assets/Editor/LevelUISetup.cs
**User Request**: "Can you also add the text show the Current level, use MCP if needed"

**Changes**:
- Added `levelText` variable to UIManager.cs to display the current level
- Updated the Update() method to refresh the level text every frame with the current level value
- Created a TextMeshProUGUI prefab (LevelTextUI.prefab) for the level display
- Added an Editor utility script (LevelUISetup.cs) to simplify adding the level UI to the scene
- Created a menu item under "Gold Miner/Setup/Add Level UI" to automatically:
  - Create the level text element on the Canvas
  - Link it to the UIManager
  - Position it appropriately in the top-left corner
- The level display updates automatically as players progress through levels
